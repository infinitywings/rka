# rka — Claude Code plugin for the Research Knowledge Agent

This is the official Claude Code plugin for [RKA](https://github.com/rka-project/rka-core). It lives inside the upstream RKA Core repository at `plugin/`, distributed via the local marketplace at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in the repo root.

> **Quick install** — see [INSTALL.md at the repo root](../INSTALL.md). The TL;DR: clone the rka repo, `docker compose up -d`, then in Claude Code: `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/cloned/rka` followed by `/plugin install rka@rka`.

---

## What this plugin provides

| Surface | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP server** | Typed `rka_query` / `rka_execute` dispatch plus schema/help operations | Available in every Claude Code session after install |
| **3 skills** | Brain, Executor, and PI | Loaded on demand for role-specific guidance |
| **5 slash commands** | Status, search, pending, explicit project pinning, and Desktop setup | Quick shortcuts; setup is one-time |
| **SessionStart hook** | Cross-platform Python; reports backend reachability and reminds callers that project ids are explicit | Fires automatically on every new session |

Academic writing is deliberately outside this plugin. Install the separate
`rka-writer` plugin only in sessions where manuscript assistance is wanted;
it consumes RKA through the public MCP contract and is never auto-activated by
RKA Core.

---

## Cross-platform support

Everything in this plugin works on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**:

- **Wrapper script** (`bin/rka-mcp-bridge.py`): Python 3, no dependencies beyond stdlib. Replaces the deprecated bash wrapper.
- **SessionStart hook** (`hooks/session-start.py`): Python 3, uses `urllib.request` for the health check.
- **Setup helper** (`scripts/setup-claude-desktop.py`): Python 3, OS-detects to find the right `claude_desktop_config.json` path, atomic merge with backup.

Path differences handled by the plugin:

| OS | Claude Desktop config | RKA `integration.json` |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | `~/Library/Application Support/RKA/integration.json` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` | `%APPDATA%\RKA\integration.json` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | `~/.local/share/RKA/integration.json` (XDG) |

Microsoft Store install vs standalone `.exe` install of Claude Desktop on Windows: both write to the same `%APPDATA%\Claude\` path. The plugin handles them uniformly.

## Prerequisites

- **RKA backend running** — Docker via `docker compose up -d` from the rka repo. Verify with `curl http://localhost:9712/api/health`.
- **`rka` stdio binary OR `integration.json`** — the wrapper script needs one of:
  1. `integration.json` written by RKA.app (future v2.4+; not yet shipped) at the OS-specific path above, with `binary_path` pointing at a working `rka` binary, OR
  2. `rka` on `PATH` (install via `uv tool install --force --reinstall .` from the rka repo — lands at `~/.local/bin/rka` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\rka.exe` on Windows).

  If neither is present, the wrapper exits with a clear error pointing at both options.
- **Python 3** — required for the wrapper, hook, and setup helper. Ships with macOS by default; install from python.org with "Add to PATH" checked on Windows; standard package on Linux.

## Connecting Claude Desktop too

Run `/rka-setup-claude-desktop` from any Claude Code chat. It calls `scripts/setup-claude-desktop.py`, which:

1. Detects your OS and the right `claude_desktop_config.json` location.
2. Verifies the RKA backend is reachable (refuses setup if not, unless `--force`).
3. Backs up the existing config to `*.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`.
4. Atomically merges the `mcpServers.rka` entry pointing at this plugin's Python wrapper.
5. Conflict-detects: refuses to replace an existing different entry without `--force`.
6. Restores from backup if any post-backup step fails.
7. Prints OS-specific quit-and-reopen instructions.

Then fully quit + reopen Claude Desktop. RKA tools become available in any new chat.

For natural-language equivalents, the `rka:rka-pi` skill teaches Claude Code to handle phrasings like *"set up RKA for Claude Desktop too"* by routing to the same command.

## Compatibility

| Plugin version | Compatible RKA versions | Wrapper compatibility glob |
|---|---|---|
| 2.0.0 (this branch) | 3.0.0 or newer | minimum `3.0.0` |

If RKA's backend version is outside the wrapper's compatibility glob, the wrapper exits with a clear error message. Either upgrade the backend or downgrade the plugin to a matching version.

---

## Development

This plugin lives at `plugin/` in the rka repo. The marketplace manifest is at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in the repo root. To iterate on the plugin:

1. Edit files under `plugin/`.
2. From any Claude Code session: `/plugin uninstall rka@rka` then `/plugin install rka@rka` — install snapshots the source tree at install time, so changes to skills, commands, hooks, or the wrapper require this refresh.
3. Restart your Claude Code session to load the new cache.

For Claude Desktop, the wrapper picks up changes automatically (no install step), but you may need to fully quit + reopen Claude Desktop to clear its in-memory MCP server connection.

## Provenance

This plugin was scaffolded as part of the empirical-verification probe for plugin architecture (mission `mis_01KQNN8YZG7A4ZAGDCQ8ZVA97Z`, decision `dec_01KQNPC7A683HK0KRX1PAGNNED` — Option B: wrapper exec's local stdio binary, no HTTP MCP bridge). The probe's findings shape the v1.0 design; future v2.4 RKA.app will automate the setup currently handled by `/rka-setup-claude-desktop`. Both ids are RKA knowledge-base entities; query them via any RKA tool (e.g., `mcp__plugin_rka_rka__rka_get(id="dec_01KQNPC7A683HK0KRX1PAGNNED")` from a Claude session, or visit the corresponding entity in the web dashboard at `http://localhost:9712`).
